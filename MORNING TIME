I sit here with a friend and we watch the noise that come out of the tv. I take in nothing therefor i put out nothing, yet the energy it takes to stay in this moment is more then i can stand. Motivation would be nice, to have the energy and the want to continue one with another day is all i ask. To be aware of the time i have and to be able to enjoy it. Staying focused is a struggle and being content is just as hard. I pray that today all will be well as well as good things fly my way. WILLIAM SHERMAN JAHNSSEN
